# Diner_Robot
This project is a CoppeliaSim based serving robot in a diner scene. The main objective is to model a 6 degree of freedom robotic arm
fixed on a 2 degree of freedom four-wheeled moving cart. Followed by the implementation of a four-wheeled differential drive, and forward-inverse kinematics and
program the model to simulate the task for autonomously navigating and completing a pre-defined job. All the calculations are verified using an independent [python
script](https://github.com/kavyadevd/Diner_Robot/blob/main/Python_Validation.html)

The robot moel in custom scene is as follows
